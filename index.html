										<h2>Projects</h2>
									</header>
									<p><strong>Predict Graduate Student retention using Machine Learning</strong>, Cornell University (10/2024 - 12/2024)<br>Developed a machine learning framework to predict student dropout risk using demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data. Employed models such as logistic regression and random forests, achieving 79.27% accuracy after applying SMOTE for class balancing. Conducted feature engineering to analyze key predictors, including tuition status and curricular unit performance, providing actionable insights for early intervention strategies to improve retention rates.<br> Project website: https://github.com/alinak78/graduate-retention-machine-learning/tree/main</br><img src="images/notebook.gif"/><br></p>
									<p><strong>Analyze Climate Resilience strategies using Natural Language Processing (Topic Modeling)</strong>, Cornell University, UT Hub (09/2023 - 12/2023)<br>Developed a natural language processing (NLP) tool to analyze climate adaptation solutions in alignment with the Toronto Resilience Strategy, which aims to help the city survive, adapt, and thrive in the face of climate change and socioeconomic inequities. Implemented topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and bigram analysis using Python libraries such as NLTK, Sklearn, and Gensim. Extracted key themes related to equity, infrastructure resilience, and climate adaptation, generating interactive visualizations for exploring prevalent topics and informing policy insights. <br> Project website: https://github.com/alinak78/resilience-project/tree/main</br><img src="images/topic_model.gif"/><br></p>
